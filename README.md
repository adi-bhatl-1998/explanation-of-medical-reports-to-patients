Many of us in our day to day life find it hard to understand the medical reports issued to us .
The aim of the project will be to create a model that can explain the medical reports generated by 
the doctors to a patient with as much ease as possible

The plan is to test out multiple llm which are trained on medical data , create an agent type of interface to communicate with the patients query ,
although I would like to be able to input the report image itself to the llm , the first functionality will be to input the patient text query 
and receive the output from the llm . I beleive this kind of system can be deloyed for each doctor's where in it captures the doctors style 
of treatment , like personalized doctor report explanation or report explanation based on each kind of tests whichever is more suitable . 

will deploy it in the form of simple user interface that takes the input , and returns the output.
